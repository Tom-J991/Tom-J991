# Hi, 
I'm Thomas Jackson a programmer from Adelaide, South Australia.

I'm currently a Student studying Game Programming at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment.

I've been programming pretty much ever since I had access to a computer and I'm extremely passionate about game programming whether it's engine, systems, gameplay programming, I'm always willing to learn new things.

I have a wide range of digital skills from C / C++ programming, C# programming, all the way to 3D modelling.

I have experience working in using Unity, Unreal Engine, and GameMaker Studio 2, working in frameworks such as Raylib, and even custom built engines.
